# Final Prompts Used for The Notebook Project

## Prompt 1: Application Architecture
Design a lightweight, browser-based Markdown note-taking application with a three-panel layout.
The application should allow users to create, edit, and manage multiple Markdown files.
All data must be stored locally in the browser using localStorage.
Use HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only.

---

## Prompt 2: User Interface Layout
Create a clean and readable three-panel layout using CSS Flexbox.
The left panel should display a list of files, the middle panel should contain a Markdown editor,
and the right panel should show a live Markdown preview.
Keep the design minimal and distraction-free.

## Prompt 3: Markdown Rendering
Explain how to implement real-time Markdown preview in a browser-based application.
Use a JavaScript Markdown parsing library to convert Markdown syntax into HTML
and update the preview dynamically as the user types.

---

## Prompt 4: Local Storage File Management
Provide JavaScript logic for creating, saving, loading, and switching between multiple text files
using the browser's localStorage API.
Ensure that all files persist after a browser refresh.

## Prompt 5: User Experience Improvements
Suggest simple user experience enhancements such as active file highlighting,
safe handling of empty states, and visual feedback to improve usability
without increasing application complexity.
